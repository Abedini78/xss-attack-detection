# 🚀 XSS Detection Using BERT

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on detecting **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks** using a fine-tuned **BERT model**. By leveraging a high-quality Kaggle dataset and advanced NLP techniques, this model aims to achieve **99.89% accuracy** with a minimal loss of **0.0012**.

## 📌 Features
✔️ **Fine-Tuned BERT Model** for XSS detection  
✔️ **High Accuracy (99.89%)** with Optimized Training  
✔️ **Uses Kaggle Dataset** with Diverse XSS Payloads  
✔️ **Scalable & Adaptable** to Various Web Applications  
✔️ **Monitors Precision, Recall & F1-score** for Effectiveness  

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing both **malicious XSS payloads** and **benign inputs**.
- It is preprocessed and tokenized to ensure compatibility with BERT.

## 🛠 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xss-detection.git
cd xss-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏗 Training the Model
To train the BERT model on the dataset:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Uses **AdamW optimizer** and **Cross-Entropy Loss**.
- Trains for optimal epochs with **early stopping**.

## 🚀 Running the Model
To detect XSS in a given input:
```bash
python detect_xss.py --input "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
```
